### Personal Information

- **Name:** Steven Knobel
- **Date:** 19 July 2024
- **Current Role/Position:** Student
- **Field of Interest:** Unsure- Coding, probably more structured like back-end rather than webdev

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - List your current skills and areas of expertise.
        Accounting (IFRS, LUXGAAP)
        Adaptability
        Time management
    - Identify skills you need to develop or improve.
        Coding language knowledge base (Primary focus on HTML, CSS and Javascript)
        Envelop some back end coding languages into my portfolio (probably start with SQL)
        Creativity (specifically learning to translate ideas into reality)
2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - Describe your key interests related to your career.
        working in an environment that is constantly changing and evolving.
    - What values are important to you in a work environment?
        Respect
        Atmosphere
        Engagement
        Positive work place

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - List the industries or roles you have researched.
        Generic research on Webdev, frontend, game design, full stack and backend
    - Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.
        Mostly interested in backend (Struggle with creativity for gaming/frontend) but am curious to learn more about the other fields of coding before making a definitive move to one kind, if specializing at all.
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - Reflect on how these industries/roles align with your skills, interests, and values.
        Backend aids to my organisation and structure, a lot more aligned with previous roles as a fund accountant
        whilst frontend/webdev and game design seem to require a lot more adaptability and creativity
    - Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.
        There are too many coding roles to specify at least this early on into my coding journey, as i would like to learn more about the responsibilities and challenges of people in roles that require a more creative and less logisitical view, such as game design or web dev.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    Finish this 6 month long coding course with Codespace
    Find an entry level role at a company that is a positive workspace that ideal promotes growth in the sense of knowledge (new languages, deeper understanding)
        does not need to be the field i want to end up in, work experience and exposure is very important
    Learn a new language outside of frontend/webdev.  (Most likely SQL as that is used largely in backend)
    narrow down the types of coding i would like to initially look into/ develop.
   
    
    - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.
    - Explain the rationale behind each goal.
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    figure out what specific kind of coding actually piques my interest and reassess the career goals needed to achieve success in the role.
        I spent 10 years becoming and working as an accountant, i have the capabilities to continue doing so i just lack the interest and enthusiasm to thrive in such a field
    find a stable field of work that peeks my interests and needs.
    
    - Outline your long-term career aspirations.
    - Describe how these align with your interests and skills.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    Complete the Codespace course
    Whilst doing so, use the teachings and community events to better research what each kind of coding job entails (full roles and responsibilities) and use this information to apply and ideally recieve a job offer in a field that has potential interest.
    utilize any and all points of growth, being new projects/ new languages etc

    - Detail specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal.
    - Include any resources or support required.
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    It is hard to prepare for long terms goals when your short term is so openended as mine is, but these will be achieved by actively spending the next 6 months with Codespace to narrow down the specific field of coding that i am interested in. 
    
    - Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations.
    - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    My goal is unfortunately very open ended which is not a good goal to set and as such causes a lot of challenges in that my time management will need to be on point to ensure i stay focused.
    - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
    - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    Be as actively involved as i can, i would like to use this 6 month window as the firt footsteps in finding a passion through work, so i would like to try anything and everything that is on offer; including, coaching sessions, community fridays, group work with my classmates, etc.
    - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth.
    - Include networking, mentorship, or educational opportunities.
